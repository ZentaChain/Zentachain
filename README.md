# Zentachain

Zentachain is a privacy-focused IoT blockchain networking project that is focused on communication and data storage. Innovative and useful solutions are provided for issues of security and data ownership. An open-source project that aims to connect decentralized networks, cloud services like IPFS, dynamic routing, and mesh networking.

The Zentachain initiative rewards users who participate in the Zentamesh activities with native cryptocurrency CHAIN, and it encourages users to support the network. It provides a method for people and businesses to stay safe without having to worry about centralized eavesdropping or surveillance. Privacy, discretion, and freedom of Telecommunication are among Zentachain's solutions.

Zentachain uses a hybrid encryption technique in its products, using several encryptions to protect sensitive information, data, and communications. The Zentalk decentralized application is not just a messenger application as it exists today like other ones which are most like a centralized network. 

Zentalk offers the ability to interact with people in a variety of situations like connection issues, network issues, or centralized data problem issues. The Zentalk messenger application is a secure messaging platform that uses blockchain technology to protect user privacy and ensure the validity of communications.

As a result, communication may be maintained even if access to the Internet is unavailable like shutdown or offline. Zentalk's security hub is visible not just in its hybrid encryptions and decentralized security, but also in Zentanodes IoT devices that guarantee long-range connections under any circumstances.

The Zentameshnet network is a mesh network that uses can comes with blockchain technology to provide secure communication and data sharing by relaying data across the network. Zentameshnet using its nodes was designed and developed by Zentachain. Zentanode can be thought of as an IoT device gateway or node point in the network.

## Zentanetwork

The Zentanetwork is designed to enable offline communication in the Zentameshnet. The ecosystem contains all the necessary technologies to create and host scalable decentralized databases, distributed services and p2p decentralized communications.

## Alnitak

Alnitak network uses the same code as the Zentachain project. In an early phase of Zentanetwork, Alnitak's mission is to be a community-driven network as a parachain to analyze the future of Zentachain.

## Zentalk

Zentalk is an ultra-secure decentralized peer-to-peer messenger application without cloud storage. Next to superior usability, users will find state-of-the-art encryption hybrid with AES-256, Diffie-Helman, RSA, and El-Gamal security. By using Zentalk with Zentanodes and the Tor network you can maintain anonymity and conduct offline communications.

## Onlinestore

Zentachain offers an online store where you can buy a Zentanode miner and support the Zentamesh network. Supporters will receive CHAIN tokens in return. Check out the doc-hub before buying a node. This [guide](https://docs.zentachain.io/zentanode/purchase-guide) introducing how you can buy a node and what you need to keep in mind.

## Zentavault

Zentavault is a high-throughput encrypted and distributed file vaulting & transfer service. The Zentavault system will not store anything on the user's device, unlike regular data storage systems. In addition to acting as an encryption delivery tool, Zentavault is also capable of dynamically encrypting and distributing content securely on the InterPlanetary File System.
