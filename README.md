# Zentachain
Zentachain is a privacy-focused IoT blockchain networking project that is focused on communication and data storage. Innovative and useful solutions are provided for issues of security and data ownership. An open-source project that aims to connect decentralized network dynamic routing and AI mesh networking. It is particularly concerned with protecting user privacy and ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information, data, and communications. To achieve these goals, Zentachain utilizes a hybrid encryption technique in its products, combining multiple encryption methods to enhance security.

One of the key offerings of the Zentachain project is the Zentalk messaging application, which is designed to be a secure and decentralized alternative to traditional messaging platforms. By using blockchain technology, Zentalk is able to protect user privacy and ensure the authenticity of communications. In addition, the application is able to maintain connectivity even in situations where internet access is unavailable, such as during network outages or when internet service is shut down.

Another important aspect of the Zentachain project is the Zentamesh network, a mesh network that allows for secure communication and data sharing between IoT devices. The network is powered similar to blockchain technology and relies on nodes, called Zentanodes, to relay data across the network. These nodes can be thought of as gateways or hubs for IoT devices, allowing them to connect and communicate with one another even in challenging conditions, such as when there are connection issues or network disruptions.

In addition to it's network foundation, the Zentamesh network also includes features such as ANN (artificial neural network) technology and Q-learning algorithms, which enable the network to adapt and improve over time through machine learning. This enables the Zentamesh network to become more efficient and effective in its communication and data sharing capabilities, helping to ensure the reliability and stability of the network as it grows.
Overall, the main focus of the Zentachain project is to provide a decentralized and secure solution for IoT networking and communication, with a strong emphasis on privacy and data protection. It rewards users who participate in its activities with its native cryptocurrency, CHAIN, and encourages them to support the network in order to help it grow and improve.

## Zentanetwork

The Zentanetwork is designed to enable offline communication in the Zentameshnet. The ecosystem contains all the necessary technologies to create and host scalable decentralized databases, distributed services and p2p decentralized communications.

## Zentalk

Zentalk is an ultra-secure decentralized peer-to-peer messenger application without cloud storage. Next to superior usability, users will find state-of-the-art encryption hybrid with AES-256, Diffie-Helman, RSA, and El-Gamal security. By using Zentalk with Zentanodes and the Tor network you can maintain anonymity and conduct offline communications.

## Zentanode

Zentanode is a device that allows users to communicate offline over a range of several kilometers. The user simply supports the network and receives CHAIN token rewards in return. The official Zentachain online store is the only place to purchase Zentanode.

## Zentanode Explorer

The Zentanode Explorer displays the currently running Zentanodes, gateways, staking, rewards, and market information, and users can connect Zentanodes with the explorer to communicate offline in a decentralized network.

## Zentalk Web

The web version of Zentalk it is currently in the stage of Alpha Testnet.

## Zentamesh

Within Zentameshnet, data is transported either by a flooding technique or a routing method. Messages take the optimal route, passing from one Zentanode to the next until they reach the destination. In order to keep the availability of all routes active in all situations, the network allows continuous connections using algorithms equipped with self-healing capabilities such as "Shortest Path Bridging".

Zentamesh has a self-healing feature as a defense mechanism against censorship resistance. Self-healing means that if a node's connection ever fails, the mesh network can patch and redirect around the lost node. Data always finds a new path and keeps the network active without interruption. Unlike existing networks, it does not require configuration and fixes many scalability and security issues "zero-config".
