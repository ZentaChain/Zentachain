# Zentachain

Zentachain is a privacy-based project that focuses on communication and data storage. Original and effective solutions are provided for security and data ownership problems. Zentachain is an open-source project and aims to bridge the gap between decentralized networks, cloud services such as IPFS, dynamic routing, and mesh-networking.

Zentachain rewards users who support the Zentanetwork with native cryptocurrency CHAIN and encourages users to support the network. It provides people and companies with a way to stay safe without having to worry about eavesdropping or spying. Privacy, confidentiality, and freedom of communication are Zentachain's top priorities.

Zentachain uses hybrid encryption within its products, employing multiple encryptions to ensure the security of data and communications. Zentalk is not just a messenger application as it exists today. Zentalk offers the possibility to communicate in a wide range between offline and offline. As a result, communication is possible even if Internet access is not available.

## Zentanetwork

The Zentanetwork is designed to enable offline communication in the Zentameshnet. The ecosystem contains all the necessary technologies to create and host scalable decentralized databases, distributed services and p2p decentralized communications.

## Katsuminetwork

Zentachain's Katsumi network uses the same code as the Zentachain project. In an early phase of Zentanetwork, Katsumi's mission is to be a community-driven network to analyze the future of Zentachain.

## Zentalk

Zentalk is an ultra-secure decentralized peer-to-peer messenger application without cloud storage. Next to superior usability, under the hood, users will find state-of-the-art encryption hybrid with AES-256, Diffie-Helman, RSA, and El-Gamal security. By using Zentalk with Zentanodes and the Tor network you can maintain anonymity and conduct offline communications.

## Zentalk Web

## Zentavault

Zentavault is a high-throughput encrypted and distributed file vaulting & transfer service. The Zentavault system will not store anything on the user's device, unlike regular data storage systems. In addition to acting as an encryption delivery tool, Zentavault is also capable of dynamically encrypting and distributing content securely on the InterPlanetary File System.
