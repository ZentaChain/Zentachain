# Zentachain

Zentachain is a privacy-focused IoT blockchain networking project that is focused on communication and data storage. Innovative and useful solutions are provided for issues of security and data ownership. An open-source project that aims to connect decentralized network dynamic routing and mesh networking.

The Zentachain initiative rewards users who participate in Zentamesh activities with the native cryptocurrency CHAIN and encourages users to support the network. It provides a way for people and businesses to stay secure without worrying about centralized networking. Privacy, data protection, and decentralized telecommunications are among Zentachain's solutions.

Zentachain uses a hybrid encryption technique in its products, using several encryptions to protect sensitive information, data, and communications. The Zentalk decentralized application is not just a messenger application as it exists today like other ones which are most like a centralized network. 

Zentalk offers the ability to interact with people in a variety of situations like connection issues, network issues, or centralized data problem issues. The Zentalk messenger application is a secure messaging platform that uses blockchain technology to protect user privacy and ensure the validity of communications.

As a result, communication may be maintained even if access to the Internet is unavailable like shutdown or offline. Zentalk's security hub is visible not just in its hybrid encryptions and decentralized security, but also in Zentanodes IoT devices that guarantee long-range connections under any circumstances.

The Zentameshnet network is a mesh network that uses can comes with blockchain technology to provide secure communication and data sharing by relaying data across the network. A Zentanode can be thought of as an IoT device gateway or node point in the network.

## Zentanetwork

The Zentanetwork is designed to enable offline communication in the Zentameshnet. The ecosystem contains all the necessary technologies to create and host scalable decentralized databases, distributed services and p2p decentralized communications.

## Zentalk

Zentalk is an ultra-secure decentralized peer-to-peer messenger application without cloud storage. Next to superior usability, users will find state-of-the-art encryption hybrid with AES-256, Diffie-Helman, RSA, and El-Gamal security. By using Zentalk with Zentanodes and the Tor network you can maintain anonymity and conduct offline communications.

## Zentanode

Zentanode is a device that allows users to communicate offline over a range of several kilometers. The user simply supports the network and receives CHAIN token rewards in return. The official Zentachain online store is the only place to purchase Zentanode.

## Zentanode Explorer

The Zentanode Explorer displays the currently running Zentanodes, gateways, staking, rewards, and market information, and users can connect Zentanodes with the explorer to communicate offline in a decentralized network.

## Zentalk Web

The web version of Zentalk it is currently in the stage of Alpha Testnet.

## Zentamesh

Within Zentameshnet, data is transported either by a flooding technique or a routing method. Messages take the optimal route, passing from one Zentanode to the next until they reach the destination. In order to keep the availability of all routes active in all situations, the network allows continuous connections using algorithms equipped with self-healing capabilities such as "Shortest Path Bridging".

Zentamesh has a self-healing feature as a defense mechanism against censorship resistance. Self-healing means that if a node's connection ever fails, the mesh network can patch and redirect around the lost node. Data always finds a new path and keeps the network active without interruption. Unlike existing networks, it does not require configuration and fixes many scalability and security issues "zero-config".

## Onlinestore

Zentachain offers an online store where you can buy a Zentanode miner and support the Zentamesh network. Supporters will receive CHAIN tokens in return. Check out the doc-hub before buying a node. This [guide](https://docs.zentachain.io/zentanode/purchase-guide) introducing how you can buy a node and what you need to keep in mind.
