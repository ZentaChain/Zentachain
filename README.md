# Zentachain
Zentachain is a privacy-focused IoT blockchain networking project that goes beyond communication and data storage. We're building a future where security, data ownership, and real-world asset (RWA) integration are paramount. As an open-source project, we connect decentralized network dynamic routing and AI mesh networking, with a strong emphasis on protecting user privacy and ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information, data, and communications. Zentachain utilizes a hybrid encryption technique, combining multiple encryption methods to enhance security.

One of the key offerings of the Zentachain project is the Zentalk messaging application, a secure and decentralized alternative to traditional messaging platforms. By using blockchain technology, Zentalk protects user privacy, ensures the authenticity of communications, and maintains connectivity even during internet outages.
Another important aspect is the Zentamesh network, a decentralized mesh network that allows for secure communication and data sharing between IoT devices.

Zentamesh relies on nodes, called Zentanodes, to relay data across the network, ensuring reliable connectivity even in challenging conditions. The network also includes AI-powered features like ANN and Q-learning algorithms to optimize performance and adapt to changing conditions.

But Zentachain's vision extends beyond just the digital realm. We are actively involved in the DePin (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) movement, bridging the gap between blockchain technology and real-world assets. Our flagship RWA project is Zenta-Go, a groundbreaking electric car-sharing platform. Zenta-Go leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized and self-sustaining mobility model, where users can securely access and share electric vehicles.

Overall, Zentachain provides a decentralized and secure solution for IoT networking and communication, with a strong emphasis on privacy and data protection. We reward users who participate in the network with our native cryptocurrency, CHAIN, encouraging them to support and contribute to the growth and improvement of the Zentachain ecosystem. By integrating RWAs like electric vehicles into our DePin network, we are building a future where blockchain technology empowers individuals and communities to create a more sustainable and efficient world.

## Chain Network (L2)

The Chain network is designed to enable offline communication in the Zentameshnet. The ecosystem contains all the necessary technologies to create and host scalable decentralized databases, distributed services and p2p decentralized communications. Additionally, you can explore the Zentachain ```$CHAIN``` token's transaction history and other details on the Ethereum blockchain through the provided [Etherscan link](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc91f1effddc4a727f4de78e400137390779ec062).

## Bridge Chain (Test-Net)

The native bridge of the Chain Network is a critical component in enabling the transfer of ETH and tokens initially created on the Layer 2 (L2) network. It plays a vital role in seamlessly connecting and harmonizing decentralized ecosystems, ensuring smooth and efficient interoperability between different blockchain platforms.

## Zentalk

Zentalk is an ultra-secure decentralized peer-to-peer messenger application without cloud storage. Next to superior usability, users will find state-of-the-art encryption hybrid with AES-256, Diffie-Helman, RSA, and El-Gamal security. By using Zentalk with Zentanodes and the Tor network you can maintain anonymity and conduct offline communications. Zentalk Web is the web-based counterpart of Zentalk Mobile, offering users a convenient way to connect their Zentanode or Gateway to the Zentamesh network. With a range of connection options available, users can easily communicate and interact with other nodes in the network through chat, including the ability to connect privately to their own nodes or those of their friends. During its Alpha Testnet stage, the development team is working to ensure that Zentalk Web provides a smooth and efficient user experience, making it an indispensable tool for maximizing the potential of the Zentamesh network.
