## Zentachain

Zentachain is a privacy-based project that focuses on communication and data storage. Original and effective solutions are provided for security and data ownership problems. Zentachain is an open-source project and objects to fill the gap between decentralized networks, and cloud services such as IPFS ​and dynamic routing.

Zentachain encourages users to support the Zentanetwork and increases security by rewarding users who support Zentanetwork with native cryptocurrency Zentachain CHAIN. The purpose of Zentachain is to provide people and companies a way to stay safe without fear of eavesdropping, spying, or getting their data. User privacy, confidentiality, and freedom of communication are the top priority for Zentachain.

Zentachain uses hybrid encryption of data and communication, applying multiple encryption. The first product Zentalk will not just be an ordinary messenger application as you know it today. Zentachain offers the possibility to communicate in a wide range between offline and offline. So users can communicate with each other even if there is no any internet connection via Zentalk App.

## Zentalk

Zentalk is a highly secure hybrid encrypted, decentralized and peer-to-peer messenger. Next to great usability, under the hood, you’ll find state-of-the-art encryption with AES-256, Diffie-Helman, RSA and El-Gamal security. Zentalk is decentralized, it has no server point. Zentachain guarantees full anonymity and offline communication between the sender and receiver using Zentanodes and the TOR-Network.

## Zentanetwork

Zentanetwork is a forkless Proof of Stake consensus for communication and data storage.

## Katsumi
Katsumi is a network of the Zentachain project. It uses the same code as Zentachain. The purpose of the Katsumi project is to be a pure community-driven network. Katsumi is the early phase of Zentachain to analyze the future of Zentachain, also known as Zentanetwork, through experimentation.

## Zentameshnet

Zentameshnet relays messages using either a flooding technique or a routing technique. With routing, the message moves along the road, jumping from one Zentanode to another one until it reaches its destination.

## Zentavault

Zentavault is a high-throughput encrypted and distributed file vault (encrypted storage) and transfer service. Unlike regular data storage systems, Zentavault will store nothing on the user's device. Zentavault acts as an encryption delivery tool, with the ability to encrypt and dynamically distribute content securely onto the InterPlanetary File System.
